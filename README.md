# KDE Snap Assist
This KWin script for KDE Plasma suggests other window thumbnails on snap. It tries to replicate famous Windows 10/11 feature called "snap assist".
Assist can be shown by dragging a window to the screen edge, as well as via default keyboard shortcuts (Super + arrows).

You can select the window with mouse, as well as with arrow keys + Enter. To dismiss the assist, you can hit Escape key, press the close button or click anywhere on the empty area.
Script also supports quarter and triple tiling now: you can switch layouts with the Tab key or using the button in corner.

Few notes:
- To apply new settings, you may need to re-enable the script or restart KWin
- Assist will not show if you have no other windows matching the conditions set in the script settings 
- I only tested the scripts on monitors with 1080p and 720p resolution with 100% scaling. It may misbehave on other resolutions or scaling â€” please report your issues
